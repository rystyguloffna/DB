Consider the following schema:

  Book(ISBN, title, year) // ISBN and title cannot be NULL
  Author(ISBN, name) // ISBN and name cannot be NULL
and the following view definition over this schema:

  Create View V as
    Select Book.ISBN, count(*)
    From Book, Author
    Where Book.ISBN = Author.ISBN
    And Author.name Like 'A%'
    And Book.year > 2000
    Group By Book.ISBN
This view is not updatable according to the SQL standard, for a number of reasons. Which of the following is a valid reason for the view being non-updatable according to the standard?

Answer:

Use of aggregate function COUNT. (Updatable views cannot include GROUP BY or aggregation.)
Use of GROUP BY. (Updatable views cannot include GROUP BY or aggregation.)
NULL values are not permitted in Book.title. (Attributes not permitted to have NULLs must be retained in updatable views.)
Two tables in FROM clause. (Updatable views must have only one table in their top-level FROM clause.)
Explanation: In order to be updatable according to the SQL standard, a view must:

Have only one table T in its top-level FROM clause
Not use SELECT DISTINCT in its top-level FROM clause
Include all attributes from T that do not permit NULLs
Not refer to T in subqueries
Not use GROUP BY or aggregation
