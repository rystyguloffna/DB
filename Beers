CREATE TABLE Beers ( name origin CHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY, CHAR (120)
CREATE TABLE Sells ( bar CHAR(20), beer CHAR(20), price REAL, FOREIGN KEY(beer) REFERENCES Beers(name) ON DELETE SET NULL, ON UPDATE CASCADE
We execute the following two queries 
DELETE FROM Beers where name 'B1' 
UPDATE Beers set Name 'B4' Where Name-'B3'; 
Now, what does this query return? 
SELECT SUM(Price) FROM Sells WHERE Sells.Beer IS NOT NULL; b) 10 c) 13 d) 20

Answer:
Ans. Option (c)

Explanation: On deletion from the parent table, the name in sells table will be set to NULL and since Cascade is used with the update so when we update parent table 
Beer the names will be updated in Sells table also. 
Now when the query runs it sums up all the price except those of NULL so total will come as 3+4+6 = 13
